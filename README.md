# Solidity

Solidity is an object-oriented programming language for writing smart contracts. It is used for implementing smart contracts on various blockchain platforms, most notably, Ethereum.

## Installation

Please refer to Official [Solidity Website](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.12/installing-solidity.html) for Full Documentation. 

## Compiler
For Compiler I used [remix.ethereum.org's](https://remix.ethereum.org) native compiler and also Deployer. It's a good online Solidity IDE for a fast start up. YOU DON'T NEED TO INSTALL ANYTHING.
## Contributing
Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
